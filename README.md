# FrugalGPT

## Directions
Let's implement a FrugalGPT service as defined in the paper [FrugalGPT: How to Use Large Language Models
While Reducing Cost and Improving Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05176)

## Assumptions
We are optimizing the following provider endpoints:
1. OpenAI
2. TextSynth

AND also our own model endpoint.

3. Preemo

For the purposes of this interview we can mock the OpenAI and TextSynth Endpoints.
